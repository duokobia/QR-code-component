## Overview
This is my third Frontend Mentor challenge. The task is undertaken with an intent to improve my frontend development skills as a junior frontend developer.

## My process

A sketch was used to approximate dimensions and how to set up the flex layout. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

- This design is responsive without the use of media query due to the dimensions used.
- Semantics html5 markup for SEO. 
- Increasing performance gain and controlling design output learnt from:
  https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/
- I am opened to comments about how to improve my frontend skills. 
- There is always something new to learn for dynamic minds.


### Continued development

- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media querry with advanced website layouts.
- writing scalable and easy to maintain code.
